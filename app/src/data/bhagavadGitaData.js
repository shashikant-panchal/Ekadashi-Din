    sanskrit: "कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि॥",
    transliteration: "karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana, mā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te saṅgo 'stv akarmaṇi",
    translation: "You have a right to perform your prescribed duty, but not to the fruits of action. Never consider yourself the cause of the results of your activities, and never be attached to not doing your duty.",
    purport: "This verse encapsulates the essence of Karma Yoga. Krishna advises Arjuna to perform his duty without attachment to results. This principle applies to all activities in life - we should focus on doing our best while surrendering the results to the Divine. This attitude leads to freedom from anxiety and enables us to maintain equanimity in success and failure."

    translation: "Whenever and wherever there is a decline in religious practice, O descendant of Bharata, and a predominant rise of irreligion—at that time I descend Myself.",
    purport: "The Supreme Lord appears in this world to reestablish dharma (righteousness) and protect the devotees. This verse assures us that divine intervention comes whenever darkness threatens to overcome light. In our personal lives, this reminds us that divine help is always available when we sincerely call upon it during difficult times."

    transliteration: "sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ",
    translation: "Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.",
    purport: "This is the ultimate instruction of the Bhagavad Gita. Complete surrender to Krishna is the highest spiritual practice. When we surrender everything to the Divine with full faith, we are freed from the burden of our past actions and future worries. This surrender doesn't mean inaction, but rather acting according to divine will while maintaining complete trust in the Supreme."
